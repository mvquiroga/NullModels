Nearest Taxon Distance (NTD) and Nucleotide Similarity of β-nearest Taxon (NS_bnASV) indexes were proposed by Fodelianakis et al. 2022 (<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-021-01106-6>). NTD and NS_bnASV code were derived from the phyloscore code (<https://github.com/sfodel/phylo_z_scores>).

Feature-level βNTI code (bNTI_feature_by_sample_create-nulls_new_modified.R, bNTI_feature_by_sample_merge-nulls_new_Ln.R) are a modification of the index proposed by Danczak et al. 2022 (<https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.803420>, original code at <https://github.com/danczakre/betaNTI-feature>).
